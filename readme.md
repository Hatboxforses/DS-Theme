## Additional Notes

A version of my "Clean Dark" theme matched to the Mint colour option of the stock DS UI.

- Thanks to FamFamFam/Mark James for the "Silk" icons used in this theme
- Thanks to Dan Taylor for the "AK Skin Edit" tool which was very useful
- Thanks to LizardWish for the excellent "PixageFX Studio" (which I used for enhanced control over RGB555 dithering)
- Thanks to all the devs behind the "ImageMagick" software (used to bulk-convert my PNGs to the final BMP files)
